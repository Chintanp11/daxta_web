                        experience working in the field of applied behaviour analysis. She joined DAXTA’s team in
                        December of 2019 as a Clinical Specialist. Her current responsibilities include developing
                        clinical tools, as well as providing behaviour analytic supervision and consultation to clinical
                        service
                        providers.

                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Gabriella was born and raised in Miami, FL and is of Salvadoran and Peruvian
                        descent. She obtained a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Florida in 2013
                        and a masters in human services psychology with an emphasis in applied behaviour analysis from
                        the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2016. While she lived in Maryland, she completed
                        her practicum at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a Johns Hopkins Hospital affiliate, where she
                        gained experience in the assessment and treatment of severe problem behaviour as well as severe
                        feeding disorders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Following her graduation, she began working as a clinician for Trumpet
                        Behavioral Health (TBH) in Southern California. At TBH, she gained experience in early
                        intervention and skill acquisition for individuals with autism and other developmental
                        disabilities. In August of 2018, Gabriella moved to San Jose, Costa Rica and began
                        working toward raising local awareness of evidence-based treatment for autism and
                        other developmental disabilities. Additionally, she began providing supervision to
                        aspiring behavior analysts in Latin America. In January of 2021, she moved to Panama
                        City, Panama. Gabriella’s recent experiences have made her a passionate advocate for
                        the ethical dissemination of sound behavior analytic therapy. DAXTA’s mission to
                        globally elevate accessibility and quality of behavior analytic treatment falls directly in
                        line with Gabriella’s values and interests to disseminate behavior analysis
