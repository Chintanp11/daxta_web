                <p>Gabriella Ulloa is a board-certified behavior analyst with nine years of experience in the field.
                    Gabriella was born and raised in Miami, FL and is of Salvadoran and Peruvian descent. She obtained a
                    bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Florida in 2013, and a master’s degree in
                    human services psychology with an emphasis in applied behavior analysis from the University of
                    Maryland, Baltimore County in 2016. While she lived in Maryland, she completed her practicum at the
                    Kennedy Krieger Institute, a Johns Hopkins Hospital affiliate, where she gained experience in the
                    assessment and treatment of severe problem behavior as well as severe feeding disorders.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">Following her graduation, she worked as a clinical supervisor for Trumpet Behavioral
                    Health (TBH) in Southern California. At TBH, she gained experience in early intervention and skill
                    acquisition for individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities. In August of 2018,
                    Gabriella moved to Costa Rica and began working toward raising local awareness of evidence-based
                    treatment for autism and other developmental disabilities. Additionally, she provided supervision to
                    aspiring behavior analysts in Latin America. In January of 2021, she moved to Panama City, Panama.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">Gabriella’s recent experiences have made her a passionate advocate for the ethical
                    dissemination of sound behavior analytic therapy. DAXTA’s mission to globally elevate accessibility
                    and quality of behavior analytic treatment falls directly in line with Gabriella’s values and
                    interests to disseminate behavior analysis internationally. Gabriella’s current responsibilities
                    include the management of software development, development of clinical tools, as well as providing
                    behavior analytic supervision and consultation to clinical service providers.</p>
